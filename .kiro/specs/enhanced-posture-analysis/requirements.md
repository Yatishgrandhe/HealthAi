# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing posture analysis API to provide more accurate person detection, comprehensive body part identification, and improved posture grading. The current system has limitations in detecting people in various poses and lighting conditions, and the posture analysis could be more precise and actionable. This enhancement will make the posture analysis more reliable, accurate, and useful for users seeking to improve their posture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user taking a posture photo, I want the system to reliably detect when I'm in the image, so that I can get accurate posture analysis even in challenging lighting or positioning scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image containing a person THEN the system SHALL detect the person with at least 90% accuracy
2. WHEN the image has poor lighting conditions THEN the system SHALL still detect the person if they are clearly visible
3. WHEN the person is in various poses (standing, sitting, side profile) THEN the system SHALL recognize them as a person
4. WHEN multiple detection methods are used THEN the system SHALL combine results for higher accuracy
5. IF no person is detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to improve the image

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user wanting posture feedback, I want the system to identify specific body parts and their positions, so that I can understand exactly which areas of my posture need improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a person is detected THEN the system SHALL identify key body parts including head, neck, shoulders, spine, hips, and limbs
2. WHEN body parts are detected THEN the system SHALL analyze their relative positions and alignment
3. WHEN analyzing body parts THEN the system SHALL detect common posture issues like forward head posture, rounded shoulders, and pelvic tilt
4. WHEN body parts are partially obscured THEN the system SHALL make reasonable inferences based on visible parts
5. IF critical body parts cannot be detected THEN the system SHALL request better positioning or lighting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user receiving posture analysis, I want accurate and consistent grading of my posture, so that I can track my progress over time and understand the severity of any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing posture THEN the system SHALL provide a numerical score from 0-100 based on objective criteria
2. WHEN calculating scores THEN the system SHALL weight different body regions appropriately (spine 30%, shoulders 20%, head/neck 20%, hips 15%, overall alignment 15%)
3. WHEN determining posture status THEN the system SHALL categorize as "excellent" (85-100), "good" (70-84), "fair" (50-69), or "poor" (0-49)
4. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL give specific, actionable recommendations based on detected issues
5. WHEN grading posture THEN the system SHALL be consistent across similar posture conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with posture issues, I want detailed analysis of specific problem areas, so that I can focus my improvement efforts on the most critical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN posture issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis for each body region
2. WHEN analyzing each region THEN the system SHALL identify specific problems and their severity
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most critical issues first
4. WHEN detecting dangerous postures THEN the system SHALL provide urgent warnings and safety recommendations
5. IF multiple issues are present THEN the system SHALL explain how they relate to each other

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the posture analysis system, I want reliable error handling and clear feedback, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it when the analysis fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide clear, user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN image quality is insufficient THEN the system SHALL specify what improvements are needed
3. WHEN the analysis partially fails THEN the system SHALL provide results for successful parts and explain what couldn't be analyzed
4. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and provide alternative feedback
5. IF the system cannot provide analysis THEN the system SHALL offer specific steps to resolve the issue

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the posture analysis API, I want consistent and well-structured response formats, so that I can reliably process the results in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns results THEN the response SHALL follow a consistent JSON structure
2. WHEN providing analysis data THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores for reliability assessment
3. WHEN returning errors THEN the system SHALL use standardized error codes and messages
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL structure them in categorized, prioritized lists
5. IF the analysis is incomplete THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which parts are missing and why
